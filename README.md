## Projects
### **Developers Productivity**<br>
In this project, we get the opportunity to review all Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to improve Teams Efficiency, Software quality, best practices and security concerns to support a large scale business.
Start from self-service and Declarative Builds and Tests, supported by standard functional requirements to guarantee all controls like Naming conventions, Code Analysis, security checks and docker signatures.
Testing Strategy we focus in review all test phases, Unit Test, "Mock Test", Contract Test, Integration Test and Smoke Test. Finally, with all of these states, we can build an ephemeral environment to support the daily basis for Eng Teams.
As an Architect for this initiative, I´ve been responsible for designing the long term vision, supporting all decisions with References Architectures and putting hands-on POCs and team support.

* CI Pipeline (PCI-DSS Compliance, Thrust of Origin by Design)
* Build Base and Parent docker images
* Declarative Build and Tests
* Declarative Compliance NFRs (Name Check, Code Analysis, Security Checks)

### **Build Large Scale Platform with Kubernetes**<br>
The main goal of this project was to leverage the platform for the next level. In a fast and Scalable Bussines, the platform should be ready to scale with even more resilience and availability capacity. 
We create a new platform to support our services with three main layers, L1 Security, L2 Traffic Management, L3 Kubernetes Orchestrator in a self-service and declarative mindset. The platform should be prepared for service migration and support all tech and security requirements from Eng. Teams.
